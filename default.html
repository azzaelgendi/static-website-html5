						Ferns thrive in cool, moist, shaded areas, which are quite common on the coast of Maine. 
						Some of the easier-to-recognize ferns are species of rock polypody, 
						which appear almost identical and are often found growing in leaf litter duff on top of large rocks. 
						The fronds are singular and look like they are growing in a small colony or mat. 
						Another pair of related common ferns are cinnamon fern and interrupted fern. 
						These two also look very much alike. 
						Both are large ferns with vegetative fronds arranged in whorls around the center. 
						Cinnamon fern has separate, fertile, spore-producing fronds which sprout from the center of the plant in spring. 
						These fronds are a cinnamon-like golden brown in color, which accounts for the plant's common name. 
						Interrupted fern produces fertile leaflets in the upper third of the vegetative fronds, hence the frond is
						"interrupted" by the smaller fertile leaflets "within" the frond. </p>

                       <p> For years, two swans graced the waters of Victoria Park Lake, along with all the Canada geese, mallard ducks and other birds.
							But the female bird died in September 2012. An autopsy revealed it had an inflammation of the brain caused by a parasite called a schistosome. The swan likely got the parasite after swallowing a snail as it scooped up plant material from the bottom of the lake.
							When Pam Kinney moved back to the area recently, and began to take walks in the park with her dog, she was astounded to see just one solitary swan.
							He seemed "sad and lonely looking, floating across the pond," Kinney said, especially with so many other water birds nearby, all in large family groups with parents watching protectively over their young. "These family groups all seemed filled with happiness, compared to the poor lone swan that drifted in silence, alone with no mate." </p>

						                        <p>There is a warning about an aggressive squirrel that has already attacked at least five people in Prospect Park.

						The city's Health Department says that all of the attacks have happened in the same area of the park - near the entrance at Parkside and Ocean Avenues.

						The squirrel has bitten people at various times throughout the day from July 18th to the 20th.

						The Health Department could not definitively say whether the animal is rabid.
